Issues:

	1. With Illustrator, you would have to manually adjust every text box, a tedious process that is not ideal for multi-page layouts.
	2. While Illustrator has kerning tools, its overall typesetting capabilities are far less developed like professional typesetting, including fine-tuned control over hyphenation, optical margin alignment, and handling of special characters like ligatures and different dash types


Typesetting Capabilities:

"Typesetting capabilities" refer to the features and functionalities available for arranging and formatting text and other visual elements (like images and graphics) on a page or screen to create a visually appealing, legible, and readable layout. 
These capabilities encompass a range of design and technical aspects that ensure text is presented effectively and professionally, both in print and digital formats. 
Key Aspects of Typesetting Capabilities:
• Font Management: The ability to select, pair, and control typefaces, font styles (bold, italic), and sizes to achieve desired aesthetics and readability for different text elements like headings, body text, and captions.
• Spacing Control: Precise adjustment of spacing between individual characters (kerning), words (word spacing), and lines of text (leading or line spacing) to enhance legibility and visual flow.
• Layout and Alignment: Tools and features for structuring the page, including setting margins, trim sizes, aligning text (left, right, center, justified), and managing the placement of elements like headers, footers, and page numbers.
• Hierarchy and Emphasis: The capacity to create a clear visual hierarchy by differentiating elements through size, weight, and style variations, drawing the reader's attention to important information and guiding them through the content.
• Integration of Visuals: Effectively incorporating and formatting images, tables, charts, and other graphics, including text wrapping and ensuring visual consistency.
• Consistency and Professionalism: Ensuring uniform visual formatting throughout a publication to maintain a cohesive and professional appearance, which builds credibility and enhances the overall reader experience.
• Software and Tools: The use of specialized software like Adobe InDesign, LaTeX, or other publishing platforms that provide the necessary functions to execute sophisticated typesetting tasks.
